### What is this repository for? ###

A hobby project of mine
A DLL injector based on shell code injection method
Modified from nyx0's code: https://github.com/nyx0/DLL-Inj3cti0n
added rewritten shell code for both 32 bit & 64 bit windows
tested on Win7 64bit using 32/64bit notepad.exe

### How do I get set up? ###
Open the visual studio solution file
use Build -> Configuration manager to switch between 32bit and 64bit
