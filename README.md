### What is this repository for? ###

A hobby project of mine <br>
A DLL injector based on shell code injection method <br>
Modified from nyx0's code: https://github.com/nyx0/DLL-Inj3cti0n <br>
added rewritten shell code for both 32 bit & 64 bit windows <br>
tested on Win7 64bit using 32/64bit notepad.exe <br>

### How do I get set up? ###
Open the visual studio solution file <br>
use Build -> Configuration manager to switch between 32bit and 64bit <br>
